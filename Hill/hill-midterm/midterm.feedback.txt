Charlie,

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 1000 wasn't enough? -1pt
It seems like you are confusing weights with error measures. -3pts
Why do you have separate w0 and w in the the pla function? The code you
provided is wrong. You are getting incorrect results. -3pts

2) Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) Good picture/drawing. +5pts


Peace,
